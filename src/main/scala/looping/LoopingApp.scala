  //How for loops are translated
  /*
  1. A simple for loop that iterates over a collection is translated to a foreach method call on the collection.
  2. A for loop with a guard (see Recipe 3.3) is translated to a sequence of a withFilter
  method call on the collection followed by a foreach call.
  3. A for loop with a yield expression is translated to a map method call on the collection.
  4. A for loop with a yield expression and a guard is translated to a withFilter method call on the collection, followed by a map method call.
